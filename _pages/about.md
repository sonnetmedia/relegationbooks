### About the site

This site was created by scratch in a text editor using some amazingly powerful tools:

- The text editor is [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/).  
- The site's HTML is generated with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and its [source](https://github.com/budparr/budparr.github.io) is freely available on Github, where it is hosted using Github's [Pages](pages.github.com) service.
- The stylesheets were written in Sass with the help of [Sassaparilla](http://sass.fffunction.co/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

### Recommendations

- We use [Cloudflare's](https://www.cloudflare.com) powerful Content Delivery Network to make the site even faster and more secure.  
- For typography we recommend [cloud.typography](http://www.typography.com/cloud/welcome/) service.
