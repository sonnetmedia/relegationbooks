>"Perhaps the greatest strength of On Bittersweet Place is its simple prose, which makes the book easily accessible. Oftentimes, a book is written from a child’s perspective yet is narrated in an embellished, complicated voice. However, this novel maintains a straightforward voice, one that Lena could have had. This prose not only renders the story more compelling but is also appropriate for one of Lena’s bigger struggles: communicating boldly with those around her." –– [**Harvard Crimson**](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2014/9/16/on-bittersweet-place/)

> "On Bittersweet Place is as much the coming-of-age story of the Midwest as a diverse and thriving urban center as it is Lena’s."

>"The novel — Wineberg’s first, following her acclaimed story collection Second Language — concerns Lena Czernitski, a young Russian Jewish immigrant trying to find her place in the glamour and darkness of 1920s Chicago." –– [**The Millions' Most-Anticipated Fall Preview, 2014** (recommended by Emily Mandel)](http://www.themillions.com/2014/07/most-anticipated-the-great-second-half-2014-book-preview.html)

> Wineberg's debut novel On Bittersweet Place will hold you in its gentle enthrall.  A coming of age novel, an immigrant story, and an altogether moving meditation on life and the pursuit of happiness." ––**Marcy Dermansky, author of Bad Marie**

![](/assets/img/on-bittersweet-place_300x463.jpg)*On Bittersweet Place* is the powerful coming-of-age story of Lena Czernitski, a young Russian Jew whose family flees their homeland in the Ukraine after the October Revolution.  The story unfolds in Chicago during the Jazz Age of the 1920's, where Lena's impoverished family has settled and where she must traverse the early years of adolescence.  Lena's new world is large and beautiful and full of promise, but it is also cold and unwelcoming and laden with danger.  Ronna Wineberg delivers a moving, universal story of family, self-discovery, young love, and the always relevant experience of the immigrant, the refugee, the outsider struggling to create a new home and a better life in an unfamiliar place.

[Ronna Wineberg](http://www.ronnawineberg.com/home.html) is the author of *On Bittersweet Place*, which is her first novel, and a debut collection, *Second Language*, which won the New Rivers Press Many Voices Project Literary Competition, and was the runner-up for the 2006 Reform Judaism Prize for Jewish Fiction. Her stories have appeared in American Way, Colorado Review, South Dakota Review and elsewhere, and been broadcast on National Public Radio. She is the recipient of fellowships from the Bread Loaf Writers Conference, New York Foundation for the Arts, Virginia Center for the Creative Arts and the Ragdale Foundation. She is the founding fiction editor of the Bellevue Literary Review, and lives in New York.

##### Relegation's first book, published in 2012

## *Wake Up, We're Here*

![](/assets/img/9780984764808-ppbk.jpg) In these collected stories of deeply human, flawed men and women in search of connection, consolation and better odds, Dallas Hudgens once again taps into the powerful and resonant view of ordinary lives made less so that has earned him national praise for his novels, *Drive Like Hell* and *Season of Gene*. In a Nation’s Capital fully occupied by the ninety-nine percent, going about the business of their lives, and in Detroit, Buffalo, Winnipeg, Oxnard and Tampa, life lays down its rhythm in dreams, promises and bills, the truth in neon light through the hazy smoke, and the telltale beat of inconstant hearts, foreclosures, and the everyday rigors of smoking, drinking, working, parenting, cheating, and praying that just one break could make it. America, down on her luck, ready for redemption, has never looked closer than this, or more like us.
