A powerful evocation of the complexities of the early 20th-century immigrant experience too often sugar-coated and sentimentalized. Rich with precise period detail and iconic historical references, _On Bittersweet Place_ brings to life the travails and triumphs of one Jewish-American family readers will not easily forget.
