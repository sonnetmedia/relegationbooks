**Things I'd be delighted to do:**
Come give a reading for your program, festival, or reading series.

Do an interview or conversation for your publication.

Lecture or guest teach at your college- or graduate-level writing program. I'm a writer who teaches because of my passionate belief in helping the next generation of young writers grow into their authentic voices and subjects. I have taught semester-long graduate seminars at NYU on the subject of plot construction, and could offer an afternoon- or weekend-length course on this topic. I recently taught a graduate master class (also at NYU) on the practicalities of giving readings; at Columbia, I taught an exercises-and-readings-based fiction workshop for grad students in non-fiction and poetry. I taught a class at Amherst on writing longer fiction, and have both lectured and taught mini-workshops focusing on the various ways fiction writers do research. I recently wrote a lecture (for Yale's popular writing course Daily Themes) on "Building Strong Characters and the Importance of Reader and Writer Sympathy," and spoke at Chautauqua a few summers back on "The Pleasures of Rereading the Classics." Please be in touch if you'd like to have me come explore one of these topics at your institution””and I'd be equally interested in creating something new.

Speak with your library or book group. Though I can't always make it in person, I'm happy to Skype or conference call.

I'm proud to say that, in the recent past, I've blurbed some really, really good books, including [_The Last Nude_](http://www.amazon.com/The-Last-Nude-Ellis-Avery/dp/1594488134/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1346877418&sr=8-1&keywords=the+last+nude) by [Ellis Avery](http://ellisavery.com), [_Suite for Three Voices_](http://www.amazon.com/Suite-Three-Voices-Derek-Furr/dp/1937677214/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1346877504&sr=1-1&keywords=suite+for+three+voices) by Derek Furr, and _Dream of an Inland Sea_ by Karen Leh. At present, I'm focusing my energies on finishing my own book and on reading the work of my students, so I regret that I am unable to offer to write a blurb for you at this time.
