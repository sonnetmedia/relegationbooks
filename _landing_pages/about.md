Relegation Books was founded in Washington, D.C., in 2012 by Dallas Hudgens, in order to exercise creative control over the publication and distribution of his work, drawing more from the DIY attitude of musicians that he admired than the experience he'd had as the author of two novels put out by a major publisher in New York. Inspired by the possibilities of small press publication as well as the holistic approach of craft distilleries that take into account everything from terroir to time, he focused on a mission of working with "an author who hadn't found an audience yet" (source:&nbsp;*Washingtonian*) and "previously published but under-recognized authors" (source: American Booksellers Association Small Press Profile). After the encouraging success of&nbsp;*Wake Up, We're Here*, Relegation Books published the novels&nbsp;*On Bittersweet Place*&nbsp;by Ronna Wineberg (winner, 2016 Shelf Unbound Best Indie Book Competition),&nbsp;*A Single Happened Thing*&nbsp;by Daniel Paisner (finalist, 2016 Foreword INDIES for Literary Fiction), and&nbsp;*The Loved Ones*&nbsp;by Sonya Chung (an Indie Next Pick and a Kirkus Reviews Best Book of 2016). Hudgens discussed Relegation Books at the Virginia Festival of the Book (2017), and was profiled by The Millions when he published&nbsp;*Wake Up, We're Here*, with Emily St. John Mandel writing that it was "easily one of the best books Iâ€™ve read this year."

Relegation Books is distributed by Itasca Books, and titles are also available via Ingram and Baker & Taylor. Lauren Cerand handles publicity, alongside a team of independent creative professionals.
