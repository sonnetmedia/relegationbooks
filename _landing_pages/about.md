Relegation Books publishes stories that stay in the game. Dallas Hudgens founded the press in 2012 in Washington, D.C., with a new vision for connecting readers with writers, informed by his own experience working with a "Big Five" publisher in New York on his first two novels. Inspired by the possibilities of small press entrepreneurial freedom as well as professional soccer teams that are relegated to lower divisions while maintaining hope of a future resurgence, Hudgens officially launched Relegation with a focus on a mission of working with “an author who hadn’t found an audience yet” (Washingtonian) and “previously published but under-recognized authors” (American Booksellers Association Small Press Profile).

After the encouraging success of Hudgens' debut story collection, _Wake Up, We’re Here_, which included Emily St. John Mandel writing that it was “easily one of the best books I’ve read this year" in a profile in The Millions, Relegation Books went on to publish the novels _On Bittersweet Place_ by Ronna Wineberg (winner, 2016 Shelf Unbound Best Indie Book Competition), _A Single Happened Thing_ by Daniel Paisner (finalist, 2016 Foreword INDIES for Literary Fiction), and _The Loved Ones_ by Sonya Chung (an Indie Next Pick and a Kirkus Reviews Best Book of 2016). 

Relegation Books is distributed by Itasca Books, and titles are also available via Ingram and Baker & Taylor. In addition to Hudgens' role as publisher and editorial director, Lauren Cerand advises on publicity, marketing and general strategy, alongside a team of independent creative professionals who come together on a project basis, including artist and Youth Attack Records founder Mark McCoy, who designed the logo, and designer and Featherproof Books founder Zach Dodson, who designs all of the covers.
