Within a multigenerational saga about family, race, and difference, The Loved Ones unfurls an elegant love story about two people bound to one another through tragedy yet kept apart by time and circumstance. The pages of this gorgeous novel gave me insight upon insight, characters I grew to love, and the most satisfying ending Iâ€™ve read in a very long time.
