This is a fearless novel, one that expands the heart. In mapping constellations of yearning and heartbreak as two families come together and fall apart, Sonya Chung not only delivers a sensual, finely wrought page-turner; she executes a radical act of compassion.&nbsp;*The Loved Ones*&nbsp;is a must-read.
